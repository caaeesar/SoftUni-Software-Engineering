            <h1>Greetings from Narnia!</h1>

            <p>
              I hope this finds you well! Narnia is even more magical than I
              imagined. The landscapes are breathtaking, and I've met the most
              fascinating creatures, including Aslan himself. Every day here is an
              adventure. I visited Cair Paravel and was awed by its beauty. I wish
              you could see it with me! Sending you lots of love and a touch of
              Narnian magic. Can't wait to share my stories when I return.
